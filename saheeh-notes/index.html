            And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah." Then you turned away, except a few of
            you, and you were refusing.</p>

            other's] blood or evict one another from your homes." Then you acknowledged [this] while you were
            witnessing.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(85) Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party
            of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as
            captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the
            Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except
            disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of
            punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(86) Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the

            Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and

            which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but
            [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah
            will be upon the disbelievers.</p>

            in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills
            from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a

            believe [only] in what was revealed to us." And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth
            confirming that which is with them. Say, "Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are
            [indeed] believers?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(92) And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in
            worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.</p>

            "Take what We have given you with determination and listen." They said [instead], "We hear and disobey." And
            their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, "How wretched is that which
            your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(94) Say, [O Muhammad], "If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and
            not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(95) But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put
            forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(96) And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more
            than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand
            years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life.

            Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that
            which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not

            understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to
            witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two

            have been killed right here." Say, "Even if you had been inside your houses, those decreed to be killed
            would have come out to their death beds." [It was] so that Allah might test what is in your breasts and
            purify what is in your hearts. And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.</p>

            And it is Allah who gives life and causes death, and Allah is Seeing of what you do.</p>

        <p class="p-text_20_body">(166) And what struck you on the day the two armies met [at Uhud] was by permission of
            Allah that He might make evident the [true] believers</p>

            them, "Come, fight in the way of Allah or [at least] defend." They said, "If we had known [there would be]
            fighting, we would have followed you." They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, saying with
            their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah is most knowing of what they conceal -</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(168) Those who said about their brothers while sitting [at home], "If they had obeyed

        <p class="p-text_20_body">(169) And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead.
            Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision,</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(170) Rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive
            good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no

        <p class="p-text_20_body">(171) They receive good tidings of favor from Allah and bounty and [of the fact] that
            Allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost -</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(172) Those [believers] who responded to Allah and the Messenger after injury had
            struck them. For those who did good among them and feared Allah is a great reward -</p>

            against you, so fear them." But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, "Sufficient for us is
            Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(174) So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them.

            was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient.</p>

        <p class="p-text_20_body">(25) And Allah invites to the Home of Peace [i.e., Paradise] and guides whom He wills
            to a straight path.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(26) For them who have done good is the best [reward] - and extra.<sup

            </sup>
            No darkness will cover their faces, nor humiliation. Those are companions of Paradise; they will abide
            therein eternally.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(27) But they who have earned [blame for] evil doings - the recompense of an evil deed
            is its equivalent, and humiliation will cover them. They will have from Allah no protector. It will be as if
            their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark [are they]. Those are the companions of the Fire;
            they will abide therein eternally.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(28) And [mention, O Muhammad], the Day We will gather them all together - then We
            will say to those who associated others with Allah, "[Remain in] your place, you and your 'partners.'"<sup

            Then We will separate them,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-595" class="citation"

            and their "partners" will say, "You did not used to worship us,<sup class="calibre3"><a
                    href="#calibre_link-596" class="citation" id="calibre_link-2481">482</a>

            &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(29) And sufficient is Allah as a witness between us and you that we were of your
            worship unaware."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(30) There, [on that Day], every soul will be put to trial for what it did previously,
            and they will be returned to Allah, their master, the Truth, and lost from them is whatever they used to
            invent.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(31) Say, "Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing
            and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges
            [every] matter?" They will say, "Allah," so say, "Then will you not fear Him?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(32) For that is Allah, your Lord, the Truth. And what can be beyond truth except
            error? So how are you averted?</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(33) Thus the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord has come into effect upon those who
            defiantly disobeyed - that they will not believe.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(34) Say, "Are there of your 'partners' any who begins creation and then repeats it?"
            Say, "Allah begins creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(35) Say, "Are there of your 'partners' any who guides to the truth?" Say, "Allah
            guides to the truth. So is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless
            he is guided? Then what is [wrong] with you - how do you judge?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(36) And most of them follow not except assumption. Indeed, assumption avails not
            against the truth at all. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(37) And it was not [possible] for this Quran to be produced by other than Allah, but
            [it is] a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about
            which there is no doubt,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-597" class="citation"

            from the Lord of the worlds.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(38) Or do they say [about the Prophet ], "He invented it?" Say, "Then bring forth a
            surah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(39) Rather, they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose
            interpretation has not yet come to them. Thus did those before them deny. Then observe how was the end of
            the wrongdoers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(40) And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe
            in it. And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(41) And if they deny you, [O Muhammad], then say, "For me are my deeds, and for you
            are your deeds. You are disassociated from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(42) And among them are those who listen to you. But can you cause the deaf to hear
            [i.e., benefit from this hearing], although they will not use reason?</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(43) And among them are those who look at you. But can you guide the blind although
            they will not [attempt to] see?</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(44) Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people at all, but it is the people who are
            wronging themselves.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(45) And on the Day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if they had not remained
            [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and] they will know each other. Those will have lost who denied the
            meeting with Allah and were not guided.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(46) And whether We show you some of what We promise them, [O Muhammad], or We take
            you in death, to Us is their return; then, [either way], Allah is a witness concerning what they are doing.
        </p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(47) And for every nation is a messenger. So when their messenger comes,<sup

            it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged.</p>

            truthful?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(49) Say, "I possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what Allah should will.
            For every nation is a [specified] term. When their time has come, then they will not remain behind an hour,
            nor will they precede [it]."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(50) Say, "Have you considered: if His punishment should come to you by night or by
            day - for which [aspect] of it would the criminals be impatient?"<sup class="calibre3"><a

            &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(52) Then it will be said to those who had wronged, "Taste the punishment of eternity;
            are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(53) And they ask information of you, [O Muhammad], "Is it true?" Say, "Yes, by my
            Lord. Indeed, it is truth; and you will not cause failure [to Allah]."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(54) And if each soul that wronged had everything on earth, it would offer it in
            ransom. And they will confide regret when they see the punishment; and they will be judged in justice, and
            they will not be wronged.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(55) Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.
            Unquestionably, the promise of Allah is truth, but most of them do not know.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(56) He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(57) O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord and healing for what
            is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(58) Say, "In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is
            better than what they accumulate."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(59) Say, "Have you seen what Allah has sent down to you of provision of which you
            have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful?" Say, "Has Allah permitted you [to do so], or do you invent
            [something] about Allah?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(60) And what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood about Allah on the
            Day of Resurrection?<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-602" class="citation"

            Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of them are not grateful.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(61) And, [O Muhammad], you are not [engaged] in any matter or recite any of the Quran
            and you [people] do not do any deed except that We are witness over you when you are involved in it. And not

            nor will they grieve -</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(63) Those who believed and were fearing Allah.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(64) For them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. No change is
            there in the words [i.e., decrees] of Allah. That is what is the great attainment.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(65) And let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, honor [due to power] belongs to
            Allah entirely. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</p>

            except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.</p>

            will make them taste the severe punishment because they used to disbelieve.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(71) And recite to them the news of Noah, when he said to his people, "O my people, if
            my residence and my reminding of the signs of Allah has become burdensome upon you - then I have relied upon

            signs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people.</p>

            magic."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(77) Moses said, "Do you say [thus] about the truth when it has come to you? Is this
            magic? But magicians will not succeed."</p>

            fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? And we are not believers in you."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(79) And Pharaoh said, "Bring to me every learned magician."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(80) So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, "Throw down whatever you will

        <p class="p-text_20_body">(66) Moses said to him, "May I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from
            what you have been taught of sound judgement?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(67) He said, "Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(68) And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(69) [Moses] said, "You will find me, if Allah wills, patient, and I will not disobey
            you in [any] order."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(70) He said, "Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make to you
            about it mention [i.e., explanation]."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(71) So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, he [i.e., al-Khidhr]
            tore it open. [Moses] said, "Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave
            thing."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(72) [Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have
            patience?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(73) [Moses] said, "Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter

            [Moses] said, "Have you killed a pure soul for other than [having killed] a soul? You have certainly done a
            deplorable thing."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(75) [Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to
            have patience?"</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(76) [Moses] said, "If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me
            as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(77) So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its
            people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to
            collapse, so he [i.e., al-Khidhr] restored it. [Moses] said, "If you wished, you could have taken for it a
            payment."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(78) [Al-Khidhr] said, "This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the
            interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(79) As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to
            cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force.</p>

            overburden them by transgression and disbelief.</p>

            purity and nearer to mercy.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(82) And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was
            beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach
            maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is
            the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience."</p>

            because they have been defiantly disobedient."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(35) And We have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use
            reason.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(36) And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shuayb, and he said, "O my people, worship
            Allah and expect the Last Day and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(37) But they denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they became within their
            home [corpses] fallen prone.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(38) And [We destroyed] Aad and Thamud, and it has become clear to you from their
            [ruined] dwellings. And Satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path, and they
            were endowed with perception.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(39) And [We destroyed] Qarun and Pharaoh and Haman. And Moses had already come to
            them with clear evidences, and they were arrogant in the land, but they were not outrunners [of Our
            punishment].</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(40) So each We seized for his sin; and among them were those upon whom We sent a
            storm of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the blast [from the sky], and among them were
            those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. And Allah would not
            have wronged them, but it was they who were wronging themselves.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(41) The example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider
            who takes [i.e., constructs] a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they
            only knew.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(42) Indeed, Allah knows whatever thing they call upon other than Him. And He is the
            Exalted in Might, the Wise.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(43) And these examples We present to the people, but none will understand them except
            those of knowledge.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(44) Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth. Indeed in that is a sign for
            the believers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(45) Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish
            prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And
            Allah knows that which you do.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(46) And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best,
            except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us
            and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(47) And thus We have sent down to you the Book [i.e., the Quran]. And those to whom
            We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe
            in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(48) And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with
            your right hand. Then [i.e., otherwise] the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(49) Rather, it [i.e., the Quran] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of
            those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(50) But they say, "Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "The signs
            are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(51) And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book [i.e., the
            Quran] which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(52) Say, "Sufficient is Allah between me and you as Witness. He knows what is in the
            heavens and earth. And they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in Allah - it is those who are
            the losers."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(53) And they urge you to hasten the punishment. And if not for [the decree of] a
            specified term, punishment would have reached them. But it will surely come to them suddenly while they
            perceive not.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(54) They urge you to hasten the punishment. And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of
            the disbelievers</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(55) On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their
            feet and it is said, "Taste [the result of] what you used to do."</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(56) O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious, so worship only Me.
        </p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(57) Every soul will taste death. Then to Us will you be returned.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(58) And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We will surely assign to
            them of Paradise [elevated] chambers beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Excellent is
            the reward of the [righteous] workers</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(59) Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(60) And how many a creature carries not its [own] provision. Allah provides for it
            and for you. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(61) If you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and
            the moon?" they would surely say, "Allah." Then how are they deluded?</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(62) Allah extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts for him.
            Indeed Allah is, of all things, Knowing.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(63) And if you asked them, "Who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby
            to the earth after its lifelessness?" they would surely say, "Allah." Say, "Praise to Allah"; but most of
            them do not reason.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(64) And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of
            the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.</p>
        <p class="p-text_20_body">(65) And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion
            [i.e., faith and hope]. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him</p>

                <p class="p-p3">Ar-Rahman and ar-Raheem are two names of Allah derived from the word "rahmah" (mercy).
                    In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of "merciful" (i.e., extremely merciful). A complimentary
                    and comprehensive meaning is intended by using both together. Rahman is used only to describe Allah,
                    while raheem might be used to describe a person as well. The Prophet &nbsp;was described in the
                    Quran as raheem. Rahman is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful). Since one usually
                    understands intensity to be something of short duration, Allah describes Himself also as raheem
                    (i.e., continually merciful). Rahman also carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation.
                    Justice is a part of this mercy. Raheem includes the concept of speciality - especially and
                    specifically merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. (See al-Qurtubi's
                    al-Jamiu li Ahkamil-Quran, pp. 103-107.)</p>
